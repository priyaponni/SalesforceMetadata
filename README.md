SalesforceMetadata
==================

Update Salesforce metadata files 

Used to change the metadata files in a Force.com Eclipse project easily. 
Helpful in modifying version number of packages, during deployment between orgs that have different versions of the same package.

Usage : &lt;folderName(folder directly containing apex files)&gt; &lt;packageName&gt; &lt;majorVersion/minorVersion&gt; &lt;newVersionNumber&gt;
