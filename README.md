SalesforceMetadata
==================

Update Salesforce metadata files 

Used to change the metadata files in a Force.com Eclipse project easily. 
Helpful in modifying version number of packages, during deployment between orgs that have different versions of the same package.

Usage : <folderName(folder directly containing apex files)> <packageName> <majorVersion/minorVersion> <newVersionNumber>
